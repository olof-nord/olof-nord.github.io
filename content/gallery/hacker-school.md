### Summary

The Hacker School is a German organisation aiming to teach children and youth programming and software developing
using a more interactive project-based approach.

The organisation is a NGO based in Hamburg, with courses all over Germany.

My participation have been focused around workshops using the [micro:bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit) 
platform, which aims to teach programming concepts and logic through a drag and drop GUI.

Despite its simplicity, the micro:bit allows for an impressive creativity and freedom.   

### Tools

* MakeCode: Web IDE
* Patience: Kids have a different (shorter) attention span
