### Summary

A Senacor internal project to evaluate the maturity of serverless (or function-as-a-service).
I was working with a small team to calculate and visualise the CO₂ emissions caused by the travelling of each employee.
This could then be compensated by CO₂ offsetting.

The taxi, flight and train data was gathered for all (500+) employees, evaluated
and visualised through different dashboards.

Note that this information is not public, and can only be accessed as a Senacor employee.

### Tools

* AWS: Serverless functions
* Angular: Frontend framework
* D3: Data visualization library
* MySQL: Persistence
